CiliumÔÉÅ
Agent
The Cilium agent (cilium-agent) runs on each node in the cluster. At a high-level, the agent accepts configuration via Kubernetes or APIs that describes networking, service load-balancing, network policies, and visibility & monitoring requirements.

The Cilium agent listens for events from orchestration systems such as Kubernetes to learn when containers or workloads are started and stopped. It manages the eBPF programs which the Linux kernel uses to control all network access in / out of those containers.

Client (CLI)
The Cilium CLI client (cilium) is a command-line tool that is installed along with the Cilium agent. It interacts with the REST API of the Cilium agent running on the same node. The CLI allows inspecting the state and status of the local agent. It also provides tooling to directly access the eBPF maps to validate their state.

Note

The in-agent Cilium CLI client described here should not be confused with the command line tool for quick-installing, managing and troubleshooting Cilium on Kubernetes clusters, which also has the name cilium. That tool is typically installed remote from the cluster, and uses kubeconfig information to access Cilium running on the cluster via the Kubernetes API.

Operator
The Cilium Operator is responsible for managing duties in the cluster which should logically be handled once for the entire cluster, rather than once for each node in the cluster. The Cilium operator is not in the critical path for any forwarding or network policy decision. A cluster will generally continue to function if the operator is temporarily unavailable. However, depending on the configuration, failure in availability of the operator can lead to:

Delays in IP Address Management (IPAM) and thus delay in scheduling of new workloads if the operator is required to allocate new IP addresses

Failure to update the kvstore heartbeat key which will lead agents to declare kvstore unhealthiness and restart.

CNI Plugin
The CNI plugin (cilium-cni) is invoked by Kubernetes when a pod is scheduled or terminated on a node. It interacts with the Cilium API of the node to trigger the necessary datapath configuration to provide networking, load-balancing and network policies for the pod.

HubbleÔÉÅ
Server
The Hubble server runs on each node and retrieves the eBPF-based visibility from Cilium. It is embedded into the Cilium agent in order to achieve high performance and low-overhead. It offers a gRPC service to retrieve flows and Prometheus metrics.

Relay
Relay (hubble-relay) is a standalone component which is aware of all running Hubble servers and offers cluster-wide visibility by connecting to their respective gRPC APIs and providing an API that represents all servers in the cluster.

Client (CLI)
The Hubble CLI (hubble) is a command-line tool able to connect to either the gRPC API of hubble-relay or the local server to retrieve flow events.

Graphical UI (GUI)
The graphical user interface (hubble-ui) utilizes relay-based visibility to provide a graphical service dependency and connectivity map.

- *IP Address Management (IPAM) with Cilium*
IP Address Management (IPAM) is responsible for the allocation and management of IP addresses used by network endpoints (container and others) managed by Cilium. Various IPAM modes are supported to meet the needs of different users:

Service-Centric Identity and API-Awareness
With traditional firewalling, workloads are identified by IP addresses and the "intent" of the communication is identified by TCP/UDP port (e.g., TCP port 80 accesses Web, TCP port 22 accesses SSH).

But with microservices, an application is deconstructed into many distinct services, with each service implemented as a collection of stateless container for scale-out performance, failure redundancy, and incremental upgrades. As a result, IP addresses are relatively ephemeral, changing meaning each time a container is created or destroyed.

Furthermore, most communication happens using only a few ports (e.g., HTTP), and the actual ‚Äúintent‚Äù of the communication between services can only be determined by understanding the API-layer ‚Äúremote procedure calls‚Äù (RPCs) between API-driven services and datastores.

A typical microservices endpoint will expose 10s or even 100s of unique RPC calls:

A RESTful HTTP-based service often exposes POST/PUT/GET/DELETE for many different resource types, each represented by a URL prefix.
A Kafka broker will often have many different topics, and allow actions like produce and consume on each topic to different clients.
A datastore like Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Mongodb, Redis, and even Mysql and Postgres provides both read and write access to many distinct tables/indices.
As a result, port-based visibility and security is blind to the individual RPC calls and will expose either all RPC between two different services or none at all.

With Cilium, identity is extracted from the container orchestrator and embedded in each network request (e.g., id=app1). Unlike an IP address, such an identity is consistent across multiple replicas implementing a service, and consistent across time. Furthermore, Cilium provides API-aware visibility and security that understands HTTP Methods/URL, gRPC service methods, Kafka topics, etc. and enables fine-grained visibility and security at the granularity of the RPCs between microservices.
